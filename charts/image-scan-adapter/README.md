![Version: 0.1.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-0.1.0-informational?style=flat-square) ![Type: application](https://img.shields.io/badge/Type-application-informational?style=flat-square) ![AppVersion: 1.16.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/AppVersion-1.16.0-informational?style=flat-square)

## Description

The Image Scan Adapter is a Kubernetes controller that integrates with image scanning tools like [Grype](https://github.com/anchore/grype) to generate image scan reports. By leveraging this adapter, users can gain greater visibility into their container images and proactively mitigate any potential security risks. The adapter can be further extended to support other image scanning tools and formats in the future.

## Installation

1. Add the Image Scan Adapter Helm repository:

```console
helm repo add image-scan-adapter https://nirmata.github.io/image-scan-adapter/
helm repo update image-scan-adapter
```

2. Install the Helm Chart, providing other parameters as described in the [Values](#values) section:

```console
helm install image-scan-adapter image-scan-adapter/image-scan-adapter --namespace image-scan-adapter --create-namespace
```

3. Verify the Image Scan Adapter installation:

```console
kubectl get pods -n image-scan-adapter
```

Wait for the image-scan-adapter pod to be in a `Running` state before continuing.

4. Check the `status` field of the `isacfg` custom resource created in the installation namespace:

```console
kubectl get isacfg -n image-scan-adapter -o yaml
```
